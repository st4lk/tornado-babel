Tornado-Babel adds i18n and l10n support to tornado with the 
help of babel and speaklater. It has builtin support for date 
formatting as well as a very simple and friendly interface 
to gettext translations.

Torando comes bundled with pretty basic locale support basic 
and does not offer support for merging translation catalogs and 
several other features most multi language applications require. 
The module also adds more date and number formatting helpers.

Tornado-Babel also includes a plugin for Babel to extract translatable 
strings from tornado templates.
